There's a phone game called "I Love Hue" - it's a puzzle game where you're given a map of blocks of different colors that are organized in a gradient across the screen.
There are two types of blocks: immobile, which are colored blocks with a black dot in the middle, that act as parameters / guides for where the others should go, and mobile ones, which you can move. 

The game works like this:
The screen shows you all the blocks placed in their correct position. After a few seconds, all the mobile blocks dissapear and come back in any other spot than where it should be. You put them back into the correct spot by tapping one block, then tapping another. They then swap positions. 

It's important to mention that their initial placement is random (as in, if you restart the level over, they will re-arrange to a different spot than before) but controlled - No two blocks simply swap positions. For example, if you had blocks labelled A - D, A could not switch places with D. A _could_ go to B, B to D, D to C, and C to A.
